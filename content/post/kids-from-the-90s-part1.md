I fondly recall my childhood, a time when I rushed home from school only to dash out again to join my friends in the neighborhood for hours of unbridled play. Those were the glorious days of the 90s when our idea of fun was kicking around a football or lounging in the park until our knees were caked in dirt. Back then, the concept of a smart mobile device was as alien to us as space travel. We communicated with our friends through landlines, and, remarkably, I can still recite most of their phone numbers from memory. Even today, we remain a close-knit group, a testament to the enduring bonds forged in those simpler times. 

One vivid memory stands out from my childhood, a day when I returned home from school and my father brought a special package from my uncle in Canada. We unwrapped it with great care, revealing a large, gray, brick-like device. My father promptly headed to the living room and embarked on the task of connecting this mysterious contraption to our television. I watched in awe as he plugged it into the TV antenna input. When he pushed the "ON" button, my eyes widened with wonder. A tiny red character appeared on the screen, jumping and maneuvering through virtual obstacles. Yes, my uncle had gifted us a Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). 

Before the NES era, my grandfather, now a spry 86 years old, shared in our gaming adventures. Our very first gaming console was an Atari with the game Arkanoid, and to this day, he continues to play a bubble shooter game on a slightly battered PSP. This, in essence, is the brief tale of how I embarked on my journey into the world of gaming at a remarkably young age. Stay tuned for Part 2, where I'll delve deeper into my gaming adventures and the evolution of this fascinating hobby.
