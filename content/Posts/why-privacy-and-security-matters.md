We live in the modern age of didital data exploitation. Big tech companies are trying to make big profits from users data and targeted-advertising. Our privacy and security is at a critical stage and everyone shall try to be more alerted of what information are exposing to the web. For starters, let me explain the difference between privacy and security from my prespective.

<strong>Privacy</strong> is the assurance that your data is only seen by the parties you itent to view it. For example, we communicate with friends through an end-to-end encrypted  chat application. We must be sure that the message has been only seen by us and the recepient (in this case our friend).

<strong>Security</strong> is the assurance that your data has not been altered during transmittion.

In many instances, while data is being transmitted, major technology corporations typically gather the metadata from our messages for the purpose of advertising. This stands out as a primary rationale for why safeguarding our privacy is imperative. Privacy fundamentally pertains to the data about individuals, and this becomes significant because we understand that possessing such information bestows authority over individuals. If we are concerned about our capacity to lead genuine, gratifying, and unrestricted lives as human beings, we need to give attention to the regulations that pertain to data concerning us. A significant portion of our contemporary society is organized around data. Whenever you engage in online shopping, peruse the news, conduct research, cast your vote, seek directions, or indeed any other activity, you are reliant on data. If we reside in a society that is defined by data, then the data related to us is of consequence, and therefore, the concept of privacy holds significance.
