I remember back in the days, we couldn't wait for the weekend just to go to the video game or music CD stores. Personally, every Saturday, I woke up at 8:00 am, and by 8:30 am, I was already on the bus heading downtown with my friends.

The first thing I would do was visit my favorite music CD store called "Traffic" and buy a music CD. Every Saturday, I bought one CD to listen to the whole week before the next Saturday. The CD Walkman was the device I used. I preferred to listen to music while I was in bed before sleeping. Back in the days, you could not listen to music with just one click in your browser. You had to actually buy the music physically, saving the money your parents gave you for school food, etc.

After the visit to the music shop, we all together went to a video game store called "Virgin." Yes, the famous "Virgin." The whole place looked like it was from another planet, with gaming consoles, CDs, gaming peripherals, and actual console games. I remember staring at all these games and never wanting to leave this place. I always targeted a game I wanted to play on my Nintendo64, so I would save money and buy it when I could. It was a big deal buying a new game back in the days. I also recall buying game cheat sheets from magazine stores. Gaming back then was difficult; some levels were just impassable, so you were looking for other solutions, such as cheat codes. We were not proud of using cheats, of course, but it was always our last resort to finish the game and go for the next one.

My point is that kids back in the days needed to work hard to achieve their goals, whether buying a CD, a game, or just reading a book to find solutions for a mathematical problem.

I was talking with a friend the other day, and we were wondering if things will ever be the same again. Of course not, things will never be the same again, but then nostalgia makes you wonder if this world is heading to become a better place.

Kids in our days can use YouTube on a smartphone device by the age of 2. They can do research in seconds using AI. Life is very easy for them in comparison to ours when we were kids. To be clear, I am not against it. It's just in my era; we used to do things very differently from this era. These are just thoughts in my mind and make me wonder where the kids in our days will end up.

Will continue to write storied in the next part. Until then, ask yourselves about a nostalgic momment in the past and what you would give to go back in time.
